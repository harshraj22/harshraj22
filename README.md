  <h3 align="right">Helloo :wave: <i>GitHubers</i> :relaxed:</h3>
  <p align="right">I'm a Backend Developer and AI Enthusiast. I got interested in programming when I understood how a <code>for loop</code> works 😮 in 2018 and since then I got interested in CS and have never looked back. Right now I write (and work) with Python, C++, MySql &amp; Javascript. I am a competitive programmer, and love 💜 to be a part of programming &amp; Open-Source communities.</p>
